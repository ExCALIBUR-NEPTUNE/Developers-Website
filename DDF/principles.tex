Starting with the most basic:
\begin{enumerate}
\item `Think and communicate before you code' \\
If you follow the guidelines this will happen anyway.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define the problem
\item Formulate a solution
\item Formalise the solution
\item Write the computer program
\end{enumerate}
\item `Write once, use many times' \\
The proposed \nep\ development is of sufficient complexity that the production
of code should be as automatic as as possible, and the `write once, use many times'
principle implies that the starting point for code generation will often be \LaTeX \ or Markdown format
documents from the DJF or indeed DDF.
\item  `Do work on the mesh representation not the particles' \\
The mesh/continuum representation is the key to any interaction
Allow (weighted) particles to merge or split: importance of kd-tree or octree,
see Martin and Cambier 2016, Teunissen and Ebert 2014, particle management Sun et al 2016 , and others
\end{enumerate}
